# first off:
# MUSYNC WILL NOT FIX BROKEN META DATA
#
# therefore if you (theoretically of course) download a bunch of 'scene'
# music and just go ahead and add them using musync - chanses are you will
# get dissapointed.  Yes, even 'scene' music sucks at tagging. Use a tagger
# like Musicbrainz Picard to properly tag your music _before_ trying to add it.
#

[general]

# This section will always be used.  All the other sections are optional
# and will only be used if specified with the key 'default-config' or if
# specifically used when running musync (-c [section],..)
# 
# When used with musync the sections are read from left to right, you will
# get an error when using cyclic options (infinite recursion).
# 
# The general rule of thumb is that each key here has it's counteroption in
# the commandline interface.  This means that writing 'pretend: true' would
# be the same as using 'musync --pretend'.  Commandline options _always_
# has precedence.

# if you look in the [main] section, you see a root and a new default-config specified.
# specifies 'default-config'

#   %(source)s - the source file (the one to be transcoded).
#   %(dest)s - the destination file (the result of the transcoding).
# uncomment these and modify to your needs.

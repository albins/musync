\subsection{Path Expansion}
Musync uses something calle \emph{path expansion}.
This is the process of taking meta data from a music file, cleaning it up to properly suite a file system.
And combining album/artist/track/name into a nicely formatted path.

Example by default configuration:
\codeblock{
artist: Mats \&{} Morgan\\
album: Trends \&{} Other Diseases\\
title: Read My Thoughts\\
track: 6
}
this will first be expanded to:
\codeblock{
artist: mats_n_morgan\\
album: trends_n_other_diseases\\
title: read_my_thoughts\\
track: 6
}
track does for apparent reasons not pass through the sed-filter.

After the cleaning process musync will use the keys dir: .. and format: .. to create a path like dir/format.

This is called the target path. The source path is the argument files that the user has provided.

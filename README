    SEE THE ChangeLog for important changes that might effect you!

    For windows users: you are on your own atm, there simply is no way to get an 'ok' working ui under windows.
                       in future we might add a few .bat scripts but plans are being laid for gui-wrapper.
                       I have added binaries for cp, md5sum and sed. These are the result of
                       http://unxutils.sourceforge.net/ so if you wan't latest version and such you should look there.

    === Dependencies ===
        * mutagen >=1.12
          http://www.sacredchao.net/quodlibet/wiki/Download
        * the common *nix tools cp, rm and sed (GNU sed is recommended)

    === Installation ===
        posix: run 'python setup.py install' as superuser (or build as normal, then install)
        
        read what it says.

        example configurations will be in:
        posix: /usr/local/musync
        windows: c:\temp

    === Configuration ===
        Musync's default configuration will not work for your system, you have to manually configure it.


    === General ===
        to use musync for adding music to your filestructure, do something like:
            
            musync -R add /path/to/album/

        or for piping:
            
            ls /path/to/music/*/* | musync add

        piping should be used in second hands since it doesn't allow musync an overview of the directories.

        deleting has similar syntax, just use 'rm'
        
        If musync complains about bad metadata, check out the log-file that was created (default /tmp/log-fixes.log)
        and run it trough some nice tagger, like musicbrainz picard.

        there is a manual in construction at svn which can be found on http://sf.net/projects/musync 

        --- what is 'fix'? ---
            i noticed that my music files really got screwed around when adding stuff to musync.sed for naming rules, and i had
            to remove a directory which hade been created by a bad rule etc.

            what 'fix' does is that it sanitychecks the files in your repository, and makes sure that no empty directories and
            files tagged differently exists.
            directories will be removed, files will just be moved.

            There is quite extensive output using this command.

    === Configuration ===
        MuSync will look for the following configuration files:
            
            /etc/musync.conf
            ~/.musync
        
        It uses the native Python RawConfigParser, which accepts the following syntax:

            [general]
            root: /path/to/foo
            root= /path/to/foo
            # I am a comment
            
        Everythin written in a section [foo] will be used by MuSync when using '-c foo', this will override options.
        The [general] section is the default section, this will always be read.

        If more than one section are read, the keys are overwritten cronologically, starting with the first read.
        this will result in the 'last' key read will be applied to the program.

    === Notes ===
        by default, the files are placed in

            %root%/%artist%/%album%/%track%-%title%.%ext%

        sed-scripting knowledge if a must if you dislike the way musync sanitizes string names.
        But if you find the interest, check the 'sed-with' option in configuration
        (default /etc/musunc.conf) and tamper with sed-naming file (default /etc/musync.sed).
        
        We stress that musync has _only_ been developed and tested under utf-8 locale system, but should be able to run properly on others as well.

        MuSync could be made operating system independant but would require some skills configuring sed and using configuration, we'll se in the future.
    
    === IMPORTANT ===
        Current behaviour when character with decimal value > 127 is encountered, it will be replaced by a series of 0xXX - hexadecimal values.
        example (if letter would not have been supported):
            Random Artist - Hallå Världen! -> random_artist - hall0xXX0xXX_v0xXX0xXXrlden
            
        This is to make sure that on cases where naming fails, it will be noticed.
        A warning will also be printed.

        a way to search for misnaming is to run the following command in you music library:

            ls -R | grep -r "0x[0-9a-e][0-9a-e]"

        Look out for these in your libraries and add them to /etc/musync.sed for proper replacing rules. Remember to comment and try to be as international as possible.
        - If you find files which are named incorrectly, please do try to fix the script musync.sed (default /etc/musync.sed) to name correctly.
        - If you feel that you have a fix that is important please send it to us!
